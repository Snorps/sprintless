# End of Mending - Minecraft Mod

Removes mending and rebalances repair cost in order to extend the gather/repair gameplay loop into the late-game.

Mending is made unobtainable in survival, and repair takes 2 resources (down from 4) as well as a flat, non-increasing xp cost based on the total levels of enchantments on the item.
